                                    <p>Two of my roommates and I decided to enter RevolutionUC's 2019 hackathon. Combining our majors of computer engineering(cmpe), computer science(cs), and construction management(cm) created a challenge when deciding on a project because of the vast difference in majors. We decided to do something hardware realted to include myself as the cmpe major and with building and design skills this should also appeal to the cm major of our group. We decided that the hardware also had to have some coding behind it to satisfy the cs major in our group. This lead us to use Arduino which is a great platform for making sensors and objects react through code. We had only had minimal experience with Arduino before the hackathon and thought it would be a fun challenge. To keep the explanation short we were able to control lego motors thorugh motor drivers that were told when to turn on and off by the <a href="images/robot2.jpg" target="_blank" class="site-link" class="img-pop-up">arduino board</a> when we wanted by controlling the ardiuno board with a wireless xbox controller.</p>

                    <p>The building I work in has over 200 cameras throughout and we are constantly installing cameras in new locations. This gives me two main jobs; managing the installation of new cameras and making sure the operators can view the cameras. When it comes to installing the cameras first comes location. This usually requires me to ask the quality group or the operators where they want cameras. Next it requires finding or installing spots to wire the cameras into our network. Finally I have to find a way to mount the camera. Usually involves designing a mount and having one of our fabricators make it. Operators can sit in areas with as many as 20 screens in front of them. Finding solutions to provide the operators with standard definition coax based video and/or high definition ip based video is challenging and keeps me quite busy.</p>

By developing HMI screens I had the oppourtunity to work on the front end and back end of the screen giving my valuable experience in interface design and taught me how to code in Visual Basic. One of the most important things I learned while working on interface design is just because its possible to do something does not mean it should be done. To elaborate, the picture shown is one of my earliest developed HMI screens. It shows numerous boxes with green and red backgrounds. Well, I'm not red-green color blind so to me I saw nothing wrong with using green for good and red for bad. Seemed pretty universally accepted to me. Well it was not until I talked to one of our senior HMI screen developers that he explained to me that some of our operators are red-green colorblind and would not be able to distinguish good for bad with my current method. He taught me its more accepted to not show any color for good things and show a flashing color for bad things. This way it would get the users attention regardless of disabilities. </p>

The numbers shown represent real time production data for a holding area. I created this application to replace a set of failing LED scoreboards the relayed the same information. This program creates less stress on the server than the failing LED scoreboards and this program can be easily changed if needed by anyone in my department.</p>
